 * main - Prints numbers from 1 to 100 with Fizz, Buzz, or FizzBuzz conditions
 *
 * Description: This program prints the numbers from 1 to 100, inclusive.
 *              However, for multiples of three, it prints "Fizz" instead
 *              of the number. For multiples of five, it prints "Buzz."
 *              For numbers that are multiples of both three and five,
 *              it prints "FizzBuzz." All output is separated by tabs.
 *
 * Return: Always 0 (success)
